          Hello, my name is Gonzalo I am fullstack javascript developer. I like
          programming and I've been doing it for a long time, I work mainly with
          the MERN stack, some of my hobbies are reading, watching anime and
          cycling. I consider myself a person who adapts and learns fast every
          day.

          design studio. My main focus these days is building accessible,
          inclusive products and digital experiences at Upstatement for a
          variety of clients.
